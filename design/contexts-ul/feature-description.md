# Feature Description Context

The _Feature Description_ context helps synchronize _**Releasy**_ with a **Task Management System** as trello, Jira, etc., where Product Owners or Product Managers declare features.

## Main features

- Follow feature creation
- Follow feature assignments
- Link feature to MRs and change sets // <== I suggest we keep change set here, on another word from a PO/PM point of view
- Follow feature progression through MR and change set updates

## Ubiquitous language
